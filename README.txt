This game is called PAINT HELL, named after the bullet hell genre.
The latest build can be found in the 'Build' folder.

Controls:
    Keyboard
        WASD: movement
        Space: jump
    Mouse
        Cursor: aim location
        Left Click: fire
        Right Click: spawn no-ai player entity (temporary)
There is also some gamepad support (using the new Input System), but it is incomplete.

When you open the game, you will find a premade level for the demo.
Right click to spawn no-AI enemies at your cursor to shoot at.
There is also wall-slides and wall-jumps.
To do a wall-slide, simply jump into a wall off the ground.
To do a wall-jump, jump while doing a wall slide.

The final version will have (at least) 3 levels, AI for FFA/team games, and a respawn system.
Goal is undecided as of now, but will probably be something like King Of The Hill or Capture The Flag.

Problems I am aware of:
    • "Paint" splatter from death makes player-entities blend into the background.
    • "Paint" splatter from death and projectiles makes seeing the collidable tiles harder.
    • Tracking the player while moving with the pixel perfect camera is janky.
