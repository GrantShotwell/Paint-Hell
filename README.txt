This game is called PAINT HELL, named after the bullet hell genre.
The latest build can be found in the 'Build' folder.

Controls:
    Keyboard
        WASD: movement
    Mouse
        Cursor: aim location
        Left Click: fire
There is also some gamepad support (using the new Input System), but it is incomplete.

There is a tutorial level, which will hopefully explain the basics.
Your gun can shoot 3 times before reloading. A white circle around your character tells you when the gun reloads.
There is a health system, it's just everything has 1 hp to keep it fast-paced (see the 'Healthbar' class).
AI are very simple for now, but I plan to keep working on this game over the summer.
Sounds for walking, shooting, and reloading are also something I want to add.

Current goal is for your team to get 10 kills.
